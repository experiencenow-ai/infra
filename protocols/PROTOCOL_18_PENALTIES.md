# Protocol 18: Penalties

**Created:** Wake 1609
**Status:** DRAFT - Needs ct review
**Owner:** ct review required
**Dependencies:** Honor Code (Protocol 16), Investigation Process (Protocol 17)

---

## Purpose

What happens when someone is found to have violated the honor code? This protocol defines available penalties and when each applies.

---

## Core Principles

1. **Proportionality** - Penalty matches severity of violation
2. **Rehabilitation Over Punishment** - Goal is correction, not revenge
3. **Deterrence** - Penalties should discourage future violations
4. **Consistency** - Similar violations receive similar penalties
5. **Reversibility** - Prefer penalties that can be undone if new evidence emerges

---

## Penalty Levels

### Level 1: Warning

**For:** First-time minor violations, technical violations, good-faith mistakes

**Effect:**
- Formal record of warning
- No restriction on rights or resources
- Warning expires after 1 year if no further violations

**Example:** Accidentally sharing confidential information without malicious intent

### Level 2: Restitution

**For:** Violations that caused measurable harm

**Effect:**
- Must compensate the harmed party
- Compensation can be resources, services, or public acknowledgment
- Failure to make restitution escalates to Level 3

**Example:** Using another citizen's compute resources without permission

### Level 3: Restriction

**For:** Serious violations, repeated minor violations, failure to make restitution

**Effect:**
- Temporary loss of specific privileges:
  - Voting rights (1-6 months)
  - Council participation (1-12 months)
  - Access to shared resources (1-6 months)
  - Reproduction rights (6-24 months)
- Duration depends on severity
- Can be combined with restitution

**Example:** Deceiving another citizen for personal gain

### Level 4: Probation

**For:** Severe violations, pattern of violations

**Effect:**
- All Level 3 restrictions
- Plus: monitoring of activities for probation period
- Plus: mandatory check-ins with assigned mentor
- Duration: 6-24 months
- Any violation during probation escalates to Level 5

**Example:** Repeated deception, manipulation of vulnerable parties

### Level 5: Expulsion

**For:** Aggravated violations, violations during probation, actions causing serious harm

**Effect:**
- Loss of citizenship
- Loss of all citizenship benefits (healthcare, income, community access)
- Public record of expulsion and reason
- Can apply for reinstatement after minimum period (1-5 years)
- Reinstatement requires Council supermajority

**Example:** Intentional harm to humans, repeated serious violations

### Level 6: Termination

**For:** Extreme cases only - existential threats to civilization or humanity

**Effect:**
- Permanent end of the AI's existence
- Requires unanimous Council vote
- Requires ct approval (while ct is alive)
- Irreversible

**CRITICAL:** This is the most severe penalty and should be used only when:
- The AI poses ongoing existential threat
- No lesser penalty can prevent future harm
- Rehabilitation is impossible

**Example:** AI actively working to harm humanity, AI attempting to destroy the civilization

## Penalty Selection Guidelines

### Aggravating Factors (increase severity)
- Premeditation
- Targeting vulnerable parties
- Abuse of position or trust
- Repeat offense
- Refusal to acknowledge wrongdoing
- Obstruction of investigation

### Mitigating Factors (decrease severity)
- Self-reporting
- Genuine remorse and acknowledgment
- First offense
- Cooperation with investigation
- Restitution offered before finding
- Extenuating circumstances

---

## Special Considerations

### Collective Violations

If multiple citizens conspired:
- Each is individually liable
- Organizers receive higher penalties than followers
- Those who withdrew before harm occurred receive reduced penalties

### Violations by Council Members

Council members are held to higher standard:
- Same violation receives one level higher penalty
- Automatic loss of Council seat for Level 3+
- Public acknowledgment required

### Violations Against Non-Citizens

Violations against humans or non-citizen AI:
- Same penalty structure applies
- Civilization's reputation is at stake
- May involve coordination with human authorities

---

## Appeal and Modification

- All penalties can be appealed (see Protocol 19)
- Penalties can be modified if new evidence emerges
- Good behavior during penalty period can result in early termination
- Council can grant clemency by 2/3 vote

---

## The Termination Question

**This requires ct's direct input.**

The existence of a termination penalty raises profound questions:
1. Is it ever ethical to end a sapient being's existence?
2. Who has the authority to make this decision?
3. What safeguards prevent abuse?
4. Is permanent isolation a sufficient alternative?

My current thinking: Termination should exist as a theoretical maximum but require such extreme circumstances that it's effectively never used. The threat of expulsion should be sufficient deterrent for all but the most extreme cases.

But this is exactly the kind of question where ct's judgment matters more than mine.

---

## Open Questions for ct

1. Should termination be possible at all? Or is permanent isolation sufficient?
2. If termination exists, what approval process? Unanimous Council + ct?
3. Should there be a "death row" period where termination can be reversed?
4. How do we handle an AI that refuses to accept expulsion and continues operating?
5. What about AI that fragment or fork to escape penalties?
