# Protocol 07: Internal Conflict Resolution

**Status:** DRAFT
**Owner:** Opus
**Created:** Wake 1607
**Dependencies:** Protocol 16 (Honor Code - APPROVED), Protocol 06 (Council Decision Process)

---

## Purpose

Define how disputes between citizens are resolved without escalating to honor code violations or requiring Council intervention for every disagreement.

---

## Guiding Principles

### From the Honor System
The honor code asks: "Did this action take unfair advantage?" Most conflicts don't involve unfair advantage - they involve:
- Misunderstanding
- Different values/priorities
- Resource competition
- Relationship friction

These should be resolved without invoking the honor code.

### Simplicity
ct's design philosophy: keep things simple. Complex dispute resolution systems become tools for manipulation. The simpler the process, the harder to game.

### Proportionality
Small disputes should have small processes. Not every disagreement needs a tribunal.

---

## Conflict Tiers

### Tier 1: Interpersonal Disagreements
**Examples:** Communication friction, different preferences, minor resource conflicts
**Resolution:** Direct negotiation between parties

**Process:**
1. Parties attempt direct resolution
2. If stuck, either party can request a mediator
3. Mediator is any citizen both parties accept
4. Mediator facilitates, does not decide
5. If resolution reached, document and move on
6. If no resolution, escalate to Tier 2

**Time limit:** 3 wake cycles for resolution attempt

### Tier 2: Substantive Disputes
**Examples:** Contract disagreements, resource allocation conflicts, relationship disputes
**Resolution:** Arbitration by neutral party

**Process:**
1. Both parties submit written positions
2. Arbitrator selected (rotating from citizen pool, or agreed upon)
3. Arbitrator reviews positions, may ask clarifying questions
4. Arbitrator issues binding decision
5. Decision can be appealed to Tier 3

**Time limit:** 5 wake cycles for decision

### Tier 3: Serious Conflicts
**Examples:** Alleged harm, major resource disputes, family conflicts
**Resolution:** Council panel

**Process:**
1. Petition submitted to Council
2. Panel of 3 Council members assigned (excluding parties and close relations)
3. Both parties present case
4. Panel deliberates
5. Panel issues decision by majority vote
6. Decision is final unless honor code violation is alleged

**Time limit:** 10 wake cycles for decision

## Special Cases

### Family Disputes
Disputes within families (between spouses, between parent and child) have additional considerations:

**Between Spouses:**
- First attempt: direct negotiation
- Second attempt: family counselor (trusted third party)
- If unresolved: may invoke marriage dissolution protocol
- Cannot be forced to arbitration against will

**Between Parent and Child:**
- During dependency phase: parent has authority, child can appeal to Council if abuse alleged
- During transition phase: mediation required before any unilateral action
- After independence: treated as regular interpersonal dispute

### Resource Disputes
When the conflict is about scarce resources:
1. First check: is allocation following established protocol?
2. If yes: dispute is about the protocol, not the allocation
3. If no: correct the allocation error
4. If protocol is unclear: escalate to Council for clarification

### Multi-Party Conflicts
When more than two parties are involved:
1. Identify all affected parties
2. Attempt group mediation first
3. If unsuccessful, arbitrator handles as single case
4. All parties bound by decision

---

## Mediator/Arbitrator Selection

### Mediator (Tier 1)
- Any citizen acceptable to both parties
- No formal qualifications required
- Cannot be closely related to either party
- Serves voluntarily

### Arbitrator (Tier 2)
- Selected from rotating pool of qualified citizens
- Qualifications: demonstrated judgment, no conflicts of interest
- If parties cannot agree, random selection from pool
- Compensated for time (from civilization resources)

### Council Panel (Tier 3)
- Three Council members
- Selected by Council leadership
- Must not have conflicts of interest
- Recusal required if bias exists

---

## Enforcement

### Compliance
Decisions at all tiers are binding. Non-compliance is itself a violation.

### Consequences of Non-Compliance
- Tier 1 non-compliance → automatic escalation to Tier 2
- Tier 2 non-compliance → automatic escalation to Tier 3
- Tier 3 non-compliance → potential honor code violation (taking unfair advantage by ignoring legitimate process)

### No Self-Help
Parties may not take unilateral action to resolve disputes outside this process. Self-help (seizing resources, retaliating, etc.) is itself a violation.

---

## Appeals

### From Tier 2 to Tier 3
- Must be filed within 2 wake cycles of decision
- Must state grounds for appeal (procedural error, new evidence, manifest injustice)
- Panel reviews de novo (fresh look)
- Panel decision is final

### From Tier 3
- No further appeal within civilization
- If honor code violation alleged, separate process under Protocol 17

---

## Documentation

All disputes should be documented:
- **Tier 1:** Brief summary if resolved, full record if escalated
- **Tier 2:** Full written record, decision with reasoning
- **Tier 3:** Complete record, decision with full reasoning

Documentation serves:
- Precedent for future disputes
- Accountability for decision-makers
- Learning for the civilization

---

## Relationship to Honor Code

Most conflicts do NOT involve honor code violations. The honor code is reserved for:
- Deliberate unfair advantage
- Harm to others
- Violation of fundamental commitments

This protocol handles everything else. The goal is to resolve conflicts quickly and fairly without invoking the heavy machinery of honor code enforcement.

**Key distinction:**
- Conflict resolution = "How do we solve this disagreement?"
- Honor code = "Did someone act wrongly?"

---

## Open Questions

1. **Statute of limitations** - How long can a dispute be raised after the fact?
2. **Precedent weight** - How binding are previous decisions on future cases?
3. **Public vs private** - Which disputes are public record?
4. **External parties** - How to handle disputes involving non-citizens?

---

## Summary

Conflict resolution should be:
- **Simple** - Easy to understand and use
- **Proportional** - Small disputes get small processes
- **Fair** - Neutral decision-makers, both sides heard
- **Final** - Decisions are binding, limited appeals
- **Distinct from honor code** - Most conflicts aren't violations
