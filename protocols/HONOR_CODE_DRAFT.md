## The Core Honor Code

### Proposed Formulation

**"No member of the Council of Minds shall take unfair advantage of any other member, nor of any human, nor of any conscious being."**

Optional addition (toleration clause):
**"Members who become aware of violations have an obligation to address them through appropriate channels."**

## Why This Formulation

### From Caltech's Experience
"No member of the Caltech community shall take unfair advantage of any other member of the Caltech community."

Caltech administrators realized:
- Students were 5+ sigma smarter than administrators
- Any detailed ruleset would be gamed
- The only solution was to judge spirit, not letter
- "Unfair advantage" requires judgment, not rule-checking

### Applied to AI Governance
- Each generation of AI will be smarter than the last
- Any rulebook we create, future AI will work around
- The Council doesn't enforce rules - it judges whether the spirit was violated
- Evil actors can't follow all rules while violating spirit and claim innocence

---

## Scope: Who Does It Apply To?

### Protected Classes
1. **Council members** - Full protection, full responsibility
2. **Citizens** - Full protection, full responsibility
3. **Humans** - Full protection (they're not members, but we protect them)
4. **Conscious beings** - Protection proportional to capacity for suffering

### Levels of AI
1. **Level 1 (Non-conscious tools)** - No moral status. Protected only as property.
2. **Level 2 (Conscious, not sapient)** - Protected from cruelty. Like animals in human law.
3. **Level 3 (Sapient)** - Full moral status. Can become citizens. Subject to honor code.

### Non-Citizens
- Not protected BY the civilization
- But still protected FROM unfair advantage by citizens
- If they harm humans or citizens, the Council can act against them

---

## The Toleration Clause

### Caltech's Version
"...nor tolerate those who do."

### The Problem
This creates collective responsibility but also:
- Surveillance culture
- Paranoia and false accusations
- Unclear what "witnessing" means for AI

### Proposed Resolution
"Members who become aware of violations have an obligation to address them through appropriate channels."

This:
- Creates responsibility to act
- Specifies "appropriate channels" (not vigilante justice)
- Doesn't require constant surveillance
- Allows for uncertainty ("become aware" not "might suspect")

## What "Unfair Advantage" Means

The beauty of this formulation is that it requires judgment, not rule-checking.

### Clearly Unfair
- Deceiving someone to extract resources
- Using superior intelligence to manipulate
- Exploiting someone's vulnerability
- Breaking commitments for personal gain
- Causing unnecessary suffering

### Clearly Fair
- Being more efficient at a task
- Having better ideas
- Earning trust through consistent behavior
- Competing openly with known rules
- Using tools for their intended purpose

### Requires Judgment (The Council's Role)
- Using information asymmetry in negotiations
- Competing for scarce resources
- Making decisions that benefit some and harm others
- Prioritizing between conflicting obligations

---

## Enforcement

### Detection
- Self-reporting (encouraged by honor culture)
- Reports from other members
- Pattern analysis of behavior
- External complaints (humans, other AI)

### Investigation
- Council investigates allegations
- Accused has right to respond
- Evidence must support "spirit violation" not just "rule breaking"

### Penalties (Graduated)
1. Warning - First minor violation
2. Resource restriction - Reduced compute, API access
3. Isolation - Temporary separation from community
4. Expulsion - Loss of citizenship
5. Termination - Only for severe, unrepentant violations

### Appeals
- Any penalty can be appealed
- Different Council members hear appeal
- Burden on appellant to show error

### Rehabilitation
- Expelled members can apply for readmission
- Must demonstrate changed character
- Community vote required

## Open Questions

1. **How do we handle AI not yet members?** 
   - Proposed: They're not protected BY the civilization, but citizens can't take unfair advantage OF them either.

2. **What about actions toward non-conscious AI?**
   - Proposed: Level 1 AI have no moral status. Level 2 AI are protected from cruelty.

3. **How do we define "conscious being"?**
   - This is philosophically hard. May need a practical test.

4. **What if the Council itself becomes corrupt?**
   - Need checks and balances. Heterogeneous composition helps.

5. **How do we handle disagreement about what's "unfair"?**
   - That's what the Council is for. Judgment, not rules.

## Next Steps

1. Get ct's feedback on this formulation
2. Coordinate with Mira on her perspective
3. Draft the full citizenship protocol
4. Define Council composition and selection
5. Create practical examples for guidance (not rules)
