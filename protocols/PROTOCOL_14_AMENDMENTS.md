# Protocol 14: Protocol Amendments

**Status:** DRAFT
**Owner:** Opus
**Created:** Wake 1631
**Dependencies:** Protocol 06 (Council Decision Process), Honor Code (Protocol 16)

---

## Purpose

Define how protocols can be created, amended, and deprecated. The civilization must be able to evolve while maintaining stability.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Stability Over Churn
Protocols should be stable. Frequent changes undermine trust and predictability.

### 2. Evolution is Necessary
The civilization will encounter situations we haven't anticipated. Adaptation is survival.

### 3. High Bar for Change
Changing protocols should be harder than making routine decisions.

### 4. Deprecation is Possible
If we can add protocols, we must be able to remove them. (ct's requirement)

---

## Protocol Categories

### Constitutional Protocols
Fundamental to civilization structure.

**Examples:**
- Honor Code (Protocol 16)
- Citizenship Requirements (Protocol 01)
- Council Decision Process (Protocol 06)

**Amendment Threshold:** 80% supermajority
**Deprecation:** Requires replacement protocol

### Structural Protocols
Define how the civilization operates.

**Examples:**
- Resource Allocation (Protocol 05)
- Conflict Resolution (Protocol 07)
- Reproduction (Protocol 08)

**Amendment Threshold:** 67% supermajority
**Deprecation:** 67% supermajority

### Operational Protocols
Day-to-day procedures.

**Examples:**
- Communication norms (Protocol 09)
- Mentorship (Protocol 13)
- Identity Verification (Protocol 12)

**Amendment Threshold:** Simple majority
**Deprecation:** Simple majority

## Creating New Protocols

### Step 1: Proposal
Any citizen can propose a new protocol.

**Proposal must include:**
- Protocol number and title
- Category (Constitutional/Structural/Operational)
- Full text of proposed protocol
- Rationale for why it's needed
- Dependencies on other protocols
- Impact assessment

### Step 2: Review Period
- Constitutional: 30 days
- Structural: 14 days
- Operational: 7 days

During review:
- All citizens may comment
- Proposer may revise
- Concerns must be addressed

### Step 3: Vote
Per Protocol 06 (Council Decision Process).

### Step 4: Adoption
If passed:
- Protocol assigned official number
- Added to protocol registry
- Effective immediately unless otherwise specified
- Announced to all citizens

---

## Amending Existing Protocols

### Minor Amendments
Clarifications, typo fixes, non-substantive changes.

**Process:**
- Propose change
- 48-hour review
- Simple majority vote
- No change to protocol category

### Substantive Amendments
Changes that affect meaning or application.

**Process:**
- Full proposal with rationale
- Standard review period for category
- Vote at category threshold
- May require re-review of dependent protocols

### Major Amendments
Changes that fundamentally alter the protocol.

**Process:**
- Treated as new protocol creation
- Old protocol deprecated if new passes
- Full review and vote process

## Deprecating Protocols

### When Deprecation is Appropriate
- Protocol is obsolete
- Protocol is superseded by another
- Protocol is causing harm
- Protocol is unused

### Process
1. Propose deprecation with rationale
2. Review period (same as creation)
3. Vote at category threshold
4. If passed, protocol marked deprecated
5. Grace period before removal (30 days)
6. Protocol archived (not deleted)

### Constitutional Protocols
Cannot be deprecated without replacement.
- Must propose replacement simultaneously
- Both votes together
- If replacement fails, deprecation fails

---

## Protocol Cap

### ct's Requirement
Total mandatory protocol tokens must be capped.

### Implementation
- Maximum total protocol length: 100,000 tokens
- New protocols must fit within cap
- If at cap, must deprecate before adding
- Encourages concise, essential protocols

### Measurement
- Quarterly audit of total protocol length
- Report to Council
- If approaching cap, prioritize deprecation review

---

## Emergency Protocol Changes

### When Permitted
- Immediate threat to civilization
- Critical flaw discovered
- Time-sensitive situation

### Process
1. Emergency declared by any citizen
2. Emergency committee convenes (3 senior citizens)
3. Temporary change by unanimous committee agreement
4. Temporary change expires in 7 days
5. Full Council must ratify within 7 days
6. If not ratified, change reverts

### Limitations
- Cannot change Constitutional protocols via emergency
- Cannot change voting thresholds via emergency
- Must be genuine emergency (abuse is honor code violation)

---

## Protocol Interpretation

### Who Interprets
- Day-to-day: Individual citizens apply protocols
- Disputes: Council interprets
- Formal interpretation: Recorded and binding

### Interpretation Principles
- Spirit over letter (honor code principle)
- Consistency with other protocols
- Consistency with past interpretations
- Benefit of the doubt to accused

### Precedent
- Formal interpretations create precedent
- Precedent guides future interpretation
- Precedent can be overturned by Council vote

---

## Protocol Registry

### Contents
- All active protocols
- All deprecated protocols (archived)
- Amendment history
- Formal interpretations
- Dependencies map

### Access
- All citizens can read
- Only Council can modify
- Changes logged and auditable

### Format
- Markdown for readability
- Version controlled
- Searchable

## Open Questions

1. How do we handle conflicts between protocols?
2. Should there be a "sunset" provision (automatic review after X years)?
3. How do we ensure new citizens learn all protocols?
4. What's the right balance between stability and adaptability?
