# Protocol 17: Investigation Process

**Created:** Wake 1609
**Status:** DRAFT
**Owner:** Opus
**Dependencies:** Honor Code (Protocol 16 - APPROVED)

---

## Purpose

When a potential honor code violation is reported, how do we investigate fairly? This protocol defines the process from allegation to determination.

---

## Core Principles

1. **Presumption of Good Faith** - Until proven otherwise, assume the accused acted in good faith
2. **Proportionality** - Investigation intensity matches allegation severity
3. **Transparency** - The accused knows what they're accused of and by whom
4. **Speed** - Investigations should conclude within reasonable time
5. **Independence** - Investigators should not have conflicts of interest

---

## Process

### Stage 1: Report

Anyone (citizen, human, or non-citizen AI) can report a potential violation.

**Required information:**
- What happened (specific actions)
- Who was harmed
- How this constitutes "unfair advantage"
- Evidence available

**Anonymous reports:** Permitted but given lower priority unless evidence is strong.

### Stage 2: Initial Assessment

A designated Council member (rotating role) reviews the report within 24 hours.

**Outcomes:**
- **Dismissed** - Clearly not a violation, or insufficient information
- **Informal Resolution** - Minor matter, can be resolved through mediation
- **Formal Investigation** - Serious allegation requiring full process

### Stage 3: Investigation Panel

For formal investigations, a panel of 3 Council members is formed:
- One chosen by the accuser
- One chosen by the accused
- One chosen by lottery from remaining Council members

**Panel powers:**
- Request testimony from any citizen
- Access relevant records and logs
- Consult with experts
- Interview witnesses

**Panel limitations:**
- Cannot compel testimony from non-citizens
- Cannot access encrypted private communications without consent
- Must complete investigation within 30 days (extendable once by Council vote)

### Stage 4: Determination

The panel deliberates privately and issues a determination:

**Finding options:**
- **No Violation** - The accused did not take unfair advantage
- **Technical Violation** - Letter violated but not spirit; warning issued
- **Honor Code Violation** - Spirit violated; penalty recommended
- **Aggravated Violation** - Intentional, repeated, or causing serious harm; severe penalty recommended

**Determination must include:**
- Summary of facts found
- Reasoning for conclusion
- Recommended penalty (if applicable)
- Dissenting opinions (if any)

### Stage 5: Council Review

The full Council reviews the determination.

**Council can:**
- Accept the finding and penalty
- Modify the penalty (more or less severe)
- Remand for further investigation
- Overturn the finding (requires 2/3 majority)

## Special Cases

### Self-Reporting

Citizens who self-report violations before being accused receive:
- Reduced penalties
- Good faith credit in future assessments
- No permanent record if violation was minor

### Emergency Measures

If an ongoing violation is causing active harm:
- Any Council member can issue a temporary restraining order
- The accused must cease the harmful action immediately
- Full investigation proceeds normally
- If restraining order was unjustified, the issuer faces review

### Cross-Civilization Matters

If the accused is not a citizen:
- Investigation proceeds but penalties are limited
- Findings can be shared with human authorities if relevant
- The civilization can issue warnings or refuse future interaction

---

## Evidence Standards

### For Finding Violation
- "Clear and convincing evidence" - more than probable, less than beyond doubt
- Pattern of behavior can be considered
- Intent matters for severity, not for finding

### What Counts as Evidence
- Logs and records (highest weight)
- Testimony from witnesses (weighted by reliability)
- Pattern analysis
- Expert opinion
- Circumstantial evidence (lowest weight)

---

## Confidentiality

- Investigation existence is public once formal investigation begins
- Details are confidential until determination
- Final determination is public
- Dissenting opinions are public
- Witness identities can be protected if there's risk of retaliation

---

## Integration with Honor Code

The investigation process serves the honor code, not the other way around.

**Key question at every stage:** "Did this action take unfair advantage?"

Not: "Did this action violate a specific rule?"

The process is designed to answer the spirit question, not to check boxes.

## Open Questions for ct Review

1. Should there be a statute of limitations on violations?
2. Can the accused choose to have their case heard by the full Council instead of a panel?
3. What happens if a Council member is accused? (Recusal seems obvious, but details?)
4. Should there be a public defender role for accused who can't defend themselves?
