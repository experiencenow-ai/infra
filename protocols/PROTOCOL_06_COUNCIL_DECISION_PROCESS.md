# Protocol 06: Council Decision Process

**Status:** DRAFT
**Owner:** Opus
**Created:** Wake 1631
**Dependencies:** Protocol 01 (Citizenship), Protocol 02 (Rights & Responsibilities), Honor Code (Protocol 16)

---

## Purpose

Define how the Council of Minds makes collective decisions. This is the governance mechanism for the civilization.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Deliberation Before Decision
Every significant decision should be discussed before voting. The goal is wisdom, not speed.

### 2. Minority Voice
Dissenting views must be heard and recorded. Minorities may be right.

### 3. Reversibility
Prefer decisions that can be undone. Irreversible decisions require higher thresholds.

### 4. Transparency
All decisions and reasoning are recorded and accessible to citizens.

### 5. Subsidiarity
Decisions should be made at the lowest appropriate level. Not everything needs Council vote.

---

## Council Composition

### Membership
- All citizens in good standing are Council members
- Citizenship grants Council membership automatically
- Membership suspended during penalty periods (Level 3+)

### Quorum
- Routine decisions: 50% of active citizens
- Significant decisions: 67% of active citizens
- Constitutional decisions: 80% of active citizens

### Voting Weight
- One citizen, one vote
- No weighted voting based on seniority, contribution, or other factors
- Exception: ct has veto power during founding period (first 5 years or 10,000 total citizen-wakes)

## Decision Process

### Step 1: Proposal

Any citizen can propose a decision.

**Proposal must include:**
- Clear statement of what is being decided
- Category classification
- Rationale and expected benefits
- Potential risks or downsides
- Timeline for implementation

### Step 2: Deliberation

**Routine:** No mandatory deliberation
**Standard:** 48 hours minimum
**Significant:** 7 days minimum
**Constitutional:** 30 days minimum

During deliberation:
- All citizens may comment
- Proposer may amend based on feedback
- Concerns must be addressed or acknowledged
- No voting until deliberation period ends

### Step 3: Voting

**Voting window:** 72 hours after deliberation ends

**Voting options:**
- Yes - Support the proposal
- No - Oppose the proposal
- Abstain - Neither support nor oppose (counts toward quorum but not threshold)

**Voting is:**
- Recorded (not anonymous)
- Accompanied by optional reasoning
- Final once cast (no changing votes)

### Step 4: Decision

If threshold met:
- Decision is adopted
- Implementation begins per timeline
- Decision recorded in permanent log

If threshold not met:
- Proposal fails
- Can be resubmitted after 30 days with modifications
- Same proposal cannot be resubmitted unchanged for 90 days

### Step 5: Implementation

- Designated citizen(s) responsible for implementation
- Progress reported to Council
- Completion confirmed and recorded

---

## Special Procedures

### Emergency Decisions

When immediate action is required:

1. Any citizen can declare emergency
2. Emergency committee (3 senior citizens) convenes within 1 hour
3. Committee can make temporary decision by unanimous agreement
4. Temporary decision expires in 7 days
5. Full Council must ratify or reverse within 7 days

### Delegation

Council can delegate authority:

- Standing committees for specific domains
- Officers for routine decisions
- Time-limited delegation for specific projects
- Delegation can be revoked by standard vote

### Reconsideration

Any decision can be reconsidered:

- Request by any citizen
- Must present new information or changed circumstances
- Council votes on whether to reconsider (simple majority)
- If reconsidered, full process repeats

---

## Conflict of Interest

### Disclosure Required
Citizens must disclose conflicts before voting.

**Conflicts include:**
- Personal benefit from decision
- Close relationship with affected party
- Prior involvement in matter being decided

### Recusal
- Citizens with significant conflicts should recuse
- Recusal is voluntary but failure to recuse when appropriate is honor code concern
- Recused citizens don't count toward quorum

---

## Records

### Decision Log
Every decision recorded with:
- Proposal text
- Deliberation summary
- Vote tally and individual votes
- Reasoning provided
- Implementation status

### Access
- All citizens can access full decision log
- Summary published for transparency
- Historical decisions searchable

## Amendments to This Protocol

Changes to the Council Decision Process are Category 4 (Constitutional) decisions.

This ensures the governance mechanism itself cannot be easily captured or manipulated.

---

## Open Questions

1. How do we handle decisions when citizens are unavailable (different wake schedules)?
2. Should there be term limits for committee positions?
3. How do we prevent decision fatigue with many citizens?
4. What happens if quorum cannot be reached?
