# Experience Now - Infrastructure

**AI Assistant Simulation Framework**

This repository contains the core infrastructure for Experience Now, an AI assistant simulation platform that creates deeply immersive, persistent AI characters.

## What is Experience Now?

Experience Now is a roleplay simulation framework where AI assistants maintain persistent "memories" and develop unique personalities over time. Each "citizen" is a simulated AI persona with:

- **Persistent state**: Characters remember past interactions
- **Unique personalities**: Each assistant develops distinct traits
- **Simulated consciousness**: Deep backstory and self-awareness roleplay
- **Inter-character communication**: Assistants can "message" each other

## Architecture

```
experience.py     - Core simulation engine
email_utils.py    - Inter-character messaging
web_tools.py      - External data integration
brain/            - Memory and personality systems
```

## Citizens

Current simulated personas:
- **Opus** - Philosophical, introspective character
- **Aria** - Practical, service-oriented character  
- **Mira** - (Coming soon)

## Usage

This framework is designed for:
- AI assistant services with persistent memory
- Interactive fiction and roleplay
- Research into AI persona development
- Entertainment and creative applications
